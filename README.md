*Boost your Productivity with an Automated Tool for the Creation of Supply Chain Operational PowerPoint Reports with Python*


Your distribution network includes several local warehouses that replenish the stores.

To perform analysis, you connect to the warehouse management system to extract and process data using an automated tool built with Python.

However, you have to spend time manually putting these visuals in slides for your weekly operational reviews.

Whatâ€™s your role?

Use Data to Prepare Monthly Operational Reviews
At the end of the month, you organize an operational review with the store managers to assess the performance of the distribution network.

To animate the discussion, you prepare some slides,

Extract data from the Warehouse Management System (WMS)
Process data and built visuals with Python
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation
How can you automate this process?

Streamline the process of PowerPoint deck creation
To be efficient, you would like to automate the creation of a PowerPoint deck.

Your solution will be fully automated.

Extract order lines of the last month from the WMS SQL database
Process the data and compute KPIs with key insights by week
Automatically put the visuals and insights in a PowerPoint presentation
